#making my first JavaScript game. before I start I want to write the sudocode here.

# function that randomly return either Rock, Paper or Scissors
function computerPlay()
    return

console.log(computerPlay())

# function that play asingle round of the game
function playRound(playerSelection, computerSelection)
    if playerSelection === computerSelection
        console.log( tie)
    else if playerSection = Rock and computerSelection = paper
        result = console.log( computer wins)
    
    else if playerSection = scissor and computerSelection = rock
        result = console.log( computer wins)

    else 
        result = console.log( player wins)

     return  "You Lose! Paper beats Rock"

# we have two vriables
const playerSelection = "rock"
const computerSelection = "computerPlay()" 
 
 # return anwer result in the console
console.log(playRound(playerSelection, computerSelection()))



# Part 2 of the game
the goal here to make a function that allows the make to run multiple times
I have two option. 1. i can copy and past the function i already have multiple times
or 2. i put it inside a for-loop

* ask for user input usingg prompt
* run the playRound function five times
* display the result in the console
* after each run store the outcome in a variable
* 

let = 5
for i = 0;
